  <h1>Our Beef</h1>
  <p>
    At our farm, we take pride in raising the highest quality beef for our
    customers. Our cattle are grass-fed and finished, which means they are never
    given hormones or antibiotics and are free to roam on pasture. Here are some
    of the reasons why our beef is the best:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Healthier: Grass-fed beef is leaner and has less saturated fat than
      conventionally raised beef.
    </li>
    <li>
      Tastier: Grass-fed beef has a more complex and rich flavor than
      conventionally raised beef.
    </li>
    <li>
      Environmentally friendly: Grass-fed beef is better for the environment
      because it promotes soil health and reduces greenhouse gas emissions.
    </li>
    <li>
      Humanely raised: Our cattle are raised in a stress-free environment and
      are treated with care and respect.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>We offer a variety of cuts of beef, including:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Steaks: Our steaks are aged for maximum flavor and tenderness.</li>
    <li>
      Ground beef: Our ground beef is made from our own grass-fed beef and is
      perfect for burgers, meatballs, and other recipes.
    </li>
    <li>Ribs: Our ribs are fall-off-the-bone tender and packed with flavor.</li>
    <li>
      Roasts: Our roasts are perfect for slow-cooking and are a delicious and
      easy meal option.
    </li>
  </ul>
